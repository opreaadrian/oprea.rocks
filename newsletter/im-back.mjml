          <mj-text>Look, I wanted to share the things I read/publish/work on, on a weekly basis, with you, the people who are actually interested in that. I also wanted to <a href="https://oprea.rocks/blog/podcast">host a podcast</a> and started to do that. Also started <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/opreaadriangeorge">a YouTube channel</a>. Guess what?! It's harder than it seems. </mj-text>
          <mj-text>I kind of messed up with this email thing, mostly because I let myself get swamped with projects and work kept piling up. I'm not going to do that anymore. I'm working to automate the process a bit, so that I don't have to "work" that much on this newsletter. I will still be the one reading, reviewing and vetting those articles and links, before they get to you. So don't be afraid, you'll never get BS articles.</mj-text>
          <mj-text>I'm letting you know because I haven't spoken to you in a while, and I don't want you to believe I started sending "newsletter" emails, out of the blue.</mj-text>
          <mj-text>
            Meanwhile, if you can forgive my inconsistency, let me get you started with three of my latest articles. I'd love to hear your thoughts on them, so when you have the time, go ahead and read the one you find most appealing. Or all three of them, for all I care. The more the merry!
