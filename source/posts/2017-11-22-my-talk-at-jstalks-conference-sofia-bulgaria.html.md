This weekend I gave a talk in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. I can tell you from the get-go that it was an awesome experience. I met a bunch of wonderful people, got to network with industry experts ranging from Microsoft MVPs to consultants with interests into WebAssembly and other topics that usually make my head explode.

## The gist 

Now, about that talk I gave. 

In a nutshell, I talked about my JavaScript tools fatigue fatigue. Although we seem to be tired of the plethora of tools that come out everyday, and the ever-changing nature of the past 3-4 years, there's also a good side to this. People are solving problems with JavaScript, and they are sometimes re-inventing the wheel for a reason. 
I tried to offer the audience some tips, from my experience, to cope with this tendency of the industry to change and re-shape itself and by the end of the presentation we also went through a couple of reasons why this tendency is good and how to "ride" the wave instead of swimming against it.

I never gave this talk before, so it was a first for me too. As far as I could tell, it was well received, and I give credit for this to the audience which was very diverse in terms of the technologies they used and the areas of IT they "belonged" to.

## The slides

Below is a link to the presentation slides. I also had a friend film the whole talk so I will be adding that to the article very soon.
