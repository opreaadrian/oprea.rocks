Last week, I attended a very inspiring workshop by [Smashingmagazine's]() very own [Vitaly Friedman]() at [SMARTWEBCONF](), a local conference for web developers and designers. Besides the usual workshop-related discussions, I also talked with Vitaly about how they handle content at [Smashingmagazine]().
Mainly the discussion revolved around performance and the use of static site generators vs. content management systems. I was very surprised to find that they are planning on moving to a fully static solution, backed by [Netlify]() for building and deploying to a CDN.
I've been running my blog for over a year now, on a mix between Jekyll and GitHub Pages. Although this has worked very well for me, this year and next year I plan on growing my consulting business even further. For this, I plan on moving everything to my new domain, [oprea.rocks](). Thanks to this discussion, I got the confirmation I needed to stick with static sites rather than moving to sophisticated, database-backed CMSs.

## Conclusion

I decided to give Middleman a chance as it offers more flexibility in terms of development, and is not exclusively focused o blogs, like Jekyll. I also started using a trial version of [Netlify]() on this blog and measure the improvements it brings.
