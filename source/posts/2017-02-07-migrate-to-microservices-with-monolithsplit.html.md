I've been working a lot with microservices in the past couple of years. It is during this time that I found how many issues can arise from disregarding architecture.

This is why I decided to create [MONOLITHSPL/T](https://monolithsplit.com), a service to help businesses decompose their Node.js monoliths into microservices. 
My goal is to provide businesses with clear, actionable steps, to move away from poor architectural decisions made in the haste.
The way I'm providing all this value is by baking knowledge and experience accumulated in the past years into microservices migration strategies, tailor-made for businesses struggling with their Node.js applications.

The service will launch very soon, and the list is tight! If you'd like to get notified about the launch, [subscribe to the pre-launch list](https://monolithsplit.com).

## In a nutshell

If you feel like reading some marketing material, head over to [monolithsplit.com](https://monolithsplit.com) and enjoy.
On the other hand, if you're not that much of a reading fan, here's the core idea behind [MONOLITHSPL/T](https://monolithsplit.com) and how I plan to help businesses implement microservices out of their Node.js monolith applications.

First, we need to talk. We will have one or two Skype calls to be able to gauge your current situation and more important, your goals. The whole strategy is built around and driven by your business goals. It will not be driven by software architects, developers, classes etc. While highly valuable, their input will only be treated as reference material, used for guidance. 

The architecture of your software ecosystem should represent your organisation. 

I'd be happy to go through [Conway's law]() with you, if you're not familiar with it. We will also create a list of people who could have valuable input regarding the past, present and future of your business. 

This may involve conducting interviews with people such as the head of the sales department, your software architect or the head of IT operations. 

I will also go through your current codebase as well as your architecture/software documentation to obtain a clear view of the problem as well as form an unbiased opinion about the architecture. 

The raw information I obtained during the interviewing / analysis process will be used to identify your core needs. Based on everything I mentioned, I will create a customized strategy for you to use in your microservices migration. 

We will have regular follow up conversations for up to 6 months. I want to make sure you are on track and making the best out of the strategy. I expect you and your team to have questions and need clarification and this is why I will follow up via email, periodically.

For businesses requiring closer guidance I can also act as a sounding board. I will make myself available to a set of designated people who can contact me directly and I will grant them access to my knowledge and experience.

## Everybody wins!

Yes, you and your business win! Remember that mobile app you postponed because it was too complicated to reuse your current data handling logic? 
Did you need to code extra functionality to pull the data independently, for the mobile app? 

With microservices you don't have that problem anymore!
You can mix and match services and quickly experiment with any new business idea that comes to mind! The fun part is that the impact (blast radius) is close to none. 
If the experiment fails, there's no harm done. It's as simple as updating a load balancer configuration and switching off a feature flag.

Some might say you migrate from monolith problems to microservices problems. 

I agree but monoliths are harder to maintain than microservices, in the long run. Their increased complexity puts a lot of pressure on the team's morale, not only on their work capacity. 

Why not have problems that help your team grow and bond? Problems they actually **want** to solve, instead of getting dragged from one release to the next.

For each risk others bring up when talking about microservices, there's a 10-fold benefit.
