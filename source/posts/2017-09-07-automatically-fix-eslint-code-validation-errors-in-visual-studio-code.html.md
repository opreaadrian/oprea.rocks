Just found this very interesting feature in Visual Studio Code. It turns out that if you break a style rule, and you get a warning from ESLint, if you click on the lightbulb that appears on the gutter, near the line number where the error is, you get a "Fix problem" option.

At first, I wasn't sure if this was built into VSCode or in the the ESLint extension I'm using. After looking into this, I found that the extension not only provides that functionality but it offers many more nice things like auto fixing all "fixable" validation errors on save.

Check it out: [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) by [Dirk Baeumer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=publisher%3A%22Dirk%20Baeumer%22&target=VSCode). By the way, it has 1.5+m installs!

This update comes after I started some refactoring work on a personal project. It was then, when I saw that the plugin is also able
to fix multiple style errors. Check it out!
