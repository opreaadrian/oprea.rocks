For some time I've been thinking of ways to better organise my article ideas.I wanted to be
able to get my content out there, to my audience, as fast and as often as possible.

I usually keep my ideas in an application such as Apple Notes or Google Keep. I've been going back and
forth between the two for the past 2 years, and they're both great tools.
The problem is that many ideas get stuck over there.  
I either end up ignoring them alltogether or merging them into larger ideas that ultimately
prove too big for me to tackle due to lack of time or other reasons.

READMORE

I remember seeing a technique online publications use to cover important events. They publish an
initial version of the article, with the level of detail they have at the time. After, as the event progresses and more information is available, the article gets updated.  

I find this approach very interesting and useful, as I think it will not allow me to abandon so 
many ideas. I'll be more motivated to add detail as I go along, and I won't be tempted to abandon any
more articles.

From now on, whenever I have an article idea that I feel would bring value to my readers, I will 
publish an initial version, with the title and an introductory section.  

I will try as much as possible to provide a final table of contents, to give people a clue on what
future updates might contain.

This way, readers will know what content they should expect from the in-progress article. 
I will also try to find a way to notify people when updates are published. 
It needs to be performed in a non-spammy way. 

I don't want to litter your inboxes with status emails like: *I'm 50%, 60%, 99.99% done*.

I'm open to suggestions so if you have more experience with this way of publishing, tweet at me
