Let me walk you through the reasons I decided to create this channel? Why did I create yet another technical tutorials channel? Don't we have enough already?
If you're curious, stick with me until the end to find out what's so different about the content on this channel. I'm going to tell you a personal story to better illustrate my reasons and hopefully you'll have some fun while viewing / listening to it.

Make sure to subscribe if you haven't done so already and share this video if you liked it. 
Let me know in the comments section if you lived through a similar situation at work.

## Video credits

Would love to give credit for the background music but I picked up at 2:00AM from SoundCloud. All I know is that the filename is called champaign_tagged.mp3
