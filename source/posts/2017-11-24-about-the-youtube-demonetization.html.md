A couple of weeks ago I was reading about the YouTube demonetization phenomenon and decided to help creators with this. I wanted to build an app that would notify them, on the spot, if their videos had been demonetized. I also wanted to add functionality to improve the appeal process and maybe help YouTube train their algorithm faster by pointing out precedents, videos that have been unfairly demonetized.

I needed someone to help me with testing, first and foremost because I don't have an account that's eligible for the YouTube Partner Program.
I started contacting popular creators who were very vocal about demonetization. Received no response. Not sure if it was because they are very busy people and don't have time to read messages, or just plain lazy. Either way, to prove that everything is legit, I even bought 2 domains and created a small webpage detailing what I need and what I plan on doing. Still no response. 

My question: are people actually bothered by this, or are they just complaining for the sake of complaining?
