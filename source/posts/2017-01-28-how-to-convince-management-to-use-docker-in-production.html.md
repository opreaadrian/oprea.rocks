So you're sold on Docker. You're using it to do your daily job but nobody knows.
You managed to create a separate environment, you have all your tools and everything needed to run all four projects you're currently working on.
You'd like to tell the team but they will probably laugh. Everybody knows that virtual machines eat up a lot of resources and your workstations aren't that powerful after all.

You know that it makes things so much easier but you're not sure if you'll ever be able to use it in production.
Simply talking to your manager and telling them about the benefits containerization brings won't cut the mustard.
Your company may even have its own datacenter and provisioning virtual machines is not an issue.

In this article I'll share with you the key points you need to touch on, with management and business people when advocating the use of Docker.
