        While many of today's practices focus on delivering a higher volume of
        work to clients, it would be wrong to think that all it takes is hard work.
        This is where I write about the knowledge and the frameworks I use to structure
        that knowledge, to aid me with project delivery.
architecture:

    description: |
        This is unavoidable in software development. The question is
        "When are you going to work on architecture, and at what cost?". I'll
        share insights on the practices I employ in architecting web applications
        and the infrastructure they live on.

        I love mobile! This is where I share the tools I use for mobile development,
        and testing.
self-development:
    name: "Self Development"
    description: |
        I'm self-taught in almost everything I do. Even though I received formal education,
        I got it long after I started working as a developer. Under this category, you'll
        find me talking about interesting articles, reviewing books I found useful for
        me as an individual, not only as a professional.
ecmascript:

        Having used JavaScript for the past 8 years, I've witnessed a lot of changes
        in the landscape. From the MooTools/Prototype era to jQuery, from Backbone to
        Angular, React and Ember. I had the time to make a lot of mistakes and also
        learned a lot about the web platform. I'd like to share my war stories with you.
devops:
    name: "DevOps"
    description: |
        I'm lazy! There, I said it! In other words, I'm all about automating repetitive
        tasks, and delegating many of my responsibilities to machines. If a computer can run
        tests on a web application front-end, then I put the time in implement that. I love
        being responsible for my application from development all the way to production so
        in this section you will "see" me talk about virtualization platforms, cloud
        providers and services, task runners and more.
