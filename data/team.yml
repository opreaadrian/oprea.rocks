        Adrian is our full-time DevOps expert! He's all about all-things-continuous (CI, CD)
        and a huge advocate of cloud technologies and Docker.
        During the past 2 years, Adrian set up continuous deployment pipelines using Jenkins and GitLab CI.
        He also migrated development environments and production applications in the cloud,
        using Docker and services like Amazon ECS, Amazon ALB/ELB, Amazon ECR, Digital Ocean etc.
        His core belief is that automation, testing and development best practices are the three
        biggest productivity boosters any development team should get.

    job_title: Senior JavaScript wizard

        We sometimes call him "the Gandalf of JavaScript".
        He started from humble beginnings, as a front-end developer, so HTML and CSS are second nature to him.
        Adrian knows JavaScript inside-out and thinks that if you take the time
        to learn the platform well enough, you can be productive with any framework or library in less than 8 hours.<br>
        Since hearing about Node.js, Adrian set himself up to master server-side JavaScript and had the chance to
        work for companies using Node.js at scale, like 1and1.
        He's helped companies adopt proper development best practices like static code analysis, proper code reviews,
        test-driven development or end-to-end testing.

        We are very lucky to have such a seasoned software engineer on our team.
        Having developed websites since the days when AJAX was just a baby and
        jQuery was in the making, we all think Adrian is our most valuable colleague.<br>
        During his office-bound career, Adrian worked on large-scale applications, ranging
        from e-commerce applications for large costmetics conglomerates, cutting-edge product
        configurators for mobile phone industry leaders, high-traffic web applications
        in the domain registration / hosting industry, all the way to customer-support solutions
        sporting websocket communication, message queues, microservices, caches etc.<br>
        Working with Adrian on critical technical decisions guarantees first-class delivery
        with a cherry on top!<br>
        We always receive great feedback regarding the depth of knowledge that
        Adrian brings to the table, as well as his proverbial pragmatism.<br>
        We've been told that his secret mantra is: <i>"Don't be wasting other people's money"</i>,
        something that we think was inspired by <a href="">Harry Roberts / @csswizardry</a>.<br>

        We pride ourselves with people who are always up to date with the ever-changing
        tech landscape. Adrian, is one of those people who cannot sit a day without learning
        something new. You can always hear him talk about a new article, an inspiring
        podcast episode or a book. He invests a considerable amount of time and money
        into his technical fitness and loves watching [egghead.io]() videos which he
        considers well-distilled and very pragmatic.
         He always manages to prove us wrong, and whenever
        he delivers an internal training, we get a highly distilled, easy to understand
        version of the material. The quality of the trainings and workshops that Adrain
        delivers helped us build a solid programming knowledge throughout our small team.
