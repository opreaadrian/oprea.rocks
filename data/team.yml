        Docker in production for multiple businesses.

    job_title: Senior JavaScript wizard

        We sometimes call him "the Gandalf of JavaScript".
        He started out as a front-end developer so HTML and CSS are second nature to him.
        Adrian knows JavaScript inside-out and is a firm believer in the fact that
        if you take the time to learn the platform well enough, you can be productive
        with any framework or library in less than 8 hours. His experience spans all the way across
        to NodeJS.

        We are very lucky to have such a seasoned software engineer on our team.
        Having developed websites since the days when AJAX was just a baby and
        jQuery was in the making, the team agrees that Adrian is our most valuable colleague.
        During his office-bound career, Adrian worked on large-scale applications, ranging
        from e-commerce for costmetics conglomerate, cutting-edge product
        configurators for mobile phone industry leaders to high-traffic web applications
        in the domain registration / hosting industry.</p>
        Our clients are always stunned when working with Adrian on critical technical
        decisions. We've received tremendous feedback regarding the depth of knowledge that
        Adrian brings to the table, as well as his proverbial pragmatism.
        We've been told that his secret mantra is: "Don't be wasting other people's money",
        something that we think was inspired by <a href="">Harry Roberts / @csswizardry</a>.

        We pride ourselves with people who are always up to date with the ever-changing
        tech landscape. Adrian, is one of those people who cannot sit a day without reading
        an article, listening to a podcast or sifting through books on Audible. We keep telling
        him that he spends too much time and money on keeping up to date and that it might
        affect his productivity. He always manages to prove us wrong, and whenever
        he delivers an internal training, we get a highly distilled, easy to understand
        version of the material. The quality of the trainings and workshops that Adrain
        delivers helped us build a solid programming knowledge throughout our small team.
